#Simple web app written in Javascript that uses Google Chrome Web Speech API to convert speech to text.

Chrome does not allow the use of Web Speech API locally in your computer, so you need to host the app on a remote server or start a server locally.

The are several methods to start a local server, like python SimpleHTTPServer module (https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html), or my personal choice due to its not-much-previous-experience-needed design: Web Server For Chrome (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb).
